# UTILITY

A web crawler is typically a script or computer program that browses the targeted website in an orderly and automated manner. It is an important method for collecting information on the Internet and is a critical component of search engine technology. Most popular search engines, such as GoogleBot and BaiduSpider, use underlying web crawlers to get the latest data on the internet.

A well behaved web crawler usually identifies itself and balances the crawling frequencies and contents and thus the bandwidth consumption. On the other hand, an ill-behaved or malicious web crawler can consume large amounts of bandwidth and cause disruptions, especially to companies that rely on web traffic or content for their business.It can be used to steal data and information from businesses with the possibility of staging DDOS attacks towards targeted websites.

# HOW TO AVOID ?

Protect the directory using an htaccess.
Be carefull some robots and penetration test robots specifically look for robots.txt files for the very purpose of visiting the disallowed site sections.
