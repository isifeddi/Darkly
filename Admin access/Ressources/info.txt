- We check the robots.txt file wich is a file that tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from a website.

- Two routes are found : /whatever and /.hidden.

- When accessing /whatever we find an htpasswd file that contains root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3 wich clearly indicates a "username:password".

- Afer decrypting the password using md5 we have : root:dragon.

- Now we need to find a page where we can use these credentials: 

    These are some most used route names for admin access
    www.website.com/administrator
    www.website.com/user
    www.website.com/login
    www.website.com/admin

- The "/admin" route  worked , we find the flag afer logging in.
