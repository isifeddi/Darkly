# EXPLANATION

When I checked the cookies I found a cookie named 'I_am_admin' which has as a value 68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327, I decrypted it using md5 and it gave "false".
So I encrypted "true" using md5 and replaced the value of the cookie.

# UTILITY

Cookie hijacking is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information.

# HOW TO AVOID ?

Avoid storing sensitive data in the cookies. And opt for a more secure encryption protocol :)
